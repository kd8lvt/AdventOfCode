# Kd's Advent of Code
Contains all my [AoC](https://adventofcode.com) repositories.  
Each year has its own branch, with the most recent year being on master.

# Usage
1. Build it with the appropriate toolchain (if required - 2024 is in .NET)
2. Put your puzzle input in the same directory as the (built executable / main file), in a file named `<day number>.txt`
3. Run the executable in a console, like so: `./2024.exe 1 true` where `1` is the day number, and `true` is a boolean for enabling debug logging.
